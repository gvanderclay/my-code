# Gage's Code

Some code that I've used on various projects that I'd like a reference too.

Most of this code was not originally written by me, rather it was taken from
projects that I have worked on and slighly modified

**Note:** This project was initialized using the [Yarn Workspaces Boilerplate](https://github.com/halkliff/yarn-workspaces-boilerplate) repository at commit [a61fd3a1248029c76d7c9a1c4a65f2f0a4fc5131](https://github.com/halkliff/yarn-workspaces-boilerplate/tree/a61fd3a1248029c76d7c9a1c4a65f2f0a4fc5131). Thanks [halkliff](https://github.com/halkliff)!
